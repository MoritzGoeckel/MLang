# MLang

This is the implementation fo a custom language called MLang. The language is build on top of ANTLR4 as the front-end and targets LLVM JIT as the backend. The project is tested with the google test framework. The language is strictly typed with complete type inference.

I build this language solely for fun and education, so maybe you should not use this in production üê¥

# Example code

For more examples refere to the [mfiles](/mfiles/) folder

```
# Loops
let i = 0;
let j = 1;
while(i < 10){
    j = j * 2;
    i = i + 1;
}
ret j;
```

```
# Infix notation
let i = 1 + 2;
# Prefix notation
let j = +(1, 2);
```

```
# Functions
let f(x) = x + 2;
ret f(11);
```

```
# Multi line functions
let f(x) = {
    let y = x + 2;
    ret y + 3;
};
ret f(10);
```

```
# Branching
let x = 1;
if(x < 3){
    ret true;
}
ret false;
```
