# Roadmap

  return and use as override. Ignore recursive return.

- Handle operator precedence for infix operators

- Enable function overloading (number / type of parameters)

- (Rework TreeWalkers to have methods per node type)

- Implement I/O build-in

- Add arrays

- Add structs

- Add pointer
